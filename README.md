# Java Method Overloading: Flexibility in Action

Welcome to the Java Method Overloading repository! This project illustrates the power and flexibility of method overloading in Java.

## Description

Method overloading is a feature in Java that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. This project showcases the concept of method overloading through the `Method` class, which contains overloaded `add` methods for adding integers and concatenating strings. The `Meth` class demonstrates how method overloading provides flexibility by allowing different method invocations based on the arguments provided.

## Usage

To explore this project:

1. Ensure Java is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Java files.
4. Compile the Java files using the command:
5. Run the compiled program using the command:
6. Observe the results printed to the console, showcasing the flexibility of method overloading.

## Features

- **Flexibility**: Learn how method overloading allows for the creation of multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists, providing flexibility in method invocation.
- **Clarity**: Understand the importance of method overloading in improving code readability and organization by providing intuitive method names for different parameter combinations.
- **Versatility**: Explore various use cases of method overloading, such as adding integers and concatenating strings, to understand its wide range of applications in Java programming.
